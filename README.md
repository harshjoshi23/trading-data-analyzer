# Trading Data Analyzer

## What is this project?
This project analyzes stock market data to predict future stock prices. We use historical data (like opening and closing prices) to understand trends and build models that can forecast prices.

## What are we trying to do?
- **Analyze Data**: Look at stock prices over time to find patterns.
- **Predict Prices**: Use machine learning (LSTM model with PyTorch) to guess future stock prices.
- **Visualize Results**: Create graphs to see trends and compare actual vs predicted prices.

## How to use this project?
1. Install the required tools (listed in `requirements.txt`).
2. Run the `analysis.ipynb` notebook to load data, analyze it, and make predictions.
3. Check the graphs and results to understand the stock price trends.

## Files in this project
- `data/Stock_Market_Data.csv`: The stock market data we analyze.
- `src/`: Python scripts for loading data, preprocessing, and modeling.
- `analysis.ipynb`: Main notebook where we do the analysis and predictions.
- `requirements.txt`: List of tools needed to run the project.

## Next Steps
- Improve the data analysis with more graphs.
- Test the model on more stocks.
- Make the predictions more accurate.
